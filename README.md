# Conan Docker Tools

![logo](logo.png)

Dockerfiles for different GCC and Clang compiler versions.
You can use these images directly in your project or with the [conan-package-tools project](https://github.com/conan-io/conan-package-tools).

### Note about Conan Docker Tools

> :warning: **Warning:**
The images listed below are intended for **generating open-source library packages** and we cannot guarantee any kind of stability. We strongly recommend using your own generated images for production environments taking the dockerfiles in this repository as a reference.

### Installation and Usage

You can use the images directly from Docker Hub, for example:

```bash
$ docker pull conanio/gcc11-ubuntu16.04:2.2.2
$ docker run -it conanio/gcc11-ubuntu16.04:2.2.2
```

**NOTE**: Always use a specific tag, like `2.2.2`, to ensure the stability of your builds. The `latest` tag is **not** stable and can change at any time.

### Storage and availability

First, [images](images/README.md#official-docker-images) folder.

All public images are stored in the Docker Hub under the `conanio` organization. You can find them [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/conanio/).

Also, there is a copy for each image used internally by ConanCenterIndexCI. These images are private and consumed by the Jenkins server. It keeps the images up-to-date, avoiding the Docker Hub rate limit and network delays.

#### Images

The images folder stores our new design, re-using the same Dockerfile for any compiler version. Consider this folder for new projects, as we will maintain it for a long period. All images generated by modern design are named using the compiler name, version, distro and its version, e.g. `conanio/gcc11-ubuntu16.04`. Only x64 is supported. Please, read the issue [#205](https://github.com/conan-io/conan-docker-tools/issues/205) to obtain more information about our decision related to design, distro version, glibc support, system package and compilers.
